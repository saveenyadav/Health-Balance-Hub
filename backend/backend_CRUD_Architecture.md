Complete CRUD Architecture Achieved:

HBH App CRUD Pattern:
CREATE → User.create() in authController.js 
READ   → User.findOne(), User.findById() in authController.js  
UPDATE → User.findByIdAndUpdate() in authController.js
DELETE → Ready to implement User.findByIdAndDelete()

 App's CRUD Capabilities:
CREATE 
User Registration (POST /api/auth/register)
Creates new user accounts in MongoDB
Hashes passwords securely with bcrypt
READ 
User Login (POST /api/auth/login) - Reads/validates user credentials
Get User Profile (GET /api/auth/user-profile) - Reads user data from database
UPDATE 
Update User Details (PUT /api/auth/updatedetails) - Updates name/email
Update Password (PUT /api/auth/updatepassword) - Updates user password
DELETE 
You have the foundation ready, but haven't implemented user deletion yet
Could easily add DELETE /api/auth/delete-account endpoint
Full CRUD Operations Confirmed:
CREATE - User registration working
READ - User authentication & profile retrieval working
UPDATE - User details & password updates working
DELETE - Ready to implement when needed
