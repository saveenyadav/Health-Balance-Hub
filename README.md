Good Afternoon everyone,

Our team name is Balanced Beings, and our project is called Health Balance Hub.

Our website focuses on three key aspects of well-being:
Nutrition, Physical Fitness, and Mental Health — because we believe true health comes from balancing all three.

The idea behind Health Balance Hub is to create a platform where users can find guidance on healthy eating, effective workout routines, and mental wellness practices — all in one.
We aim to build a clean, user-friendly design, interactive features, and valuable content for everyday people looking to improve their health.

Technically, it will be a full-stack project — built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. We'll also use GitHub for collaboration and follow industry-standard coding practices.

Our goal is to create a website that's both informative and engaging —
a space that helps users take small steps toward a healthier, balanced life.
